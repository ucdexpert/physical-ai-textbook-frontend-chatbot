# Research: Docusaurus Best Practices for Technical Documentation

This document outlines research tasks to ensure the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" is built using the best available Docusaurus features and practices.

## Research Tasks

### 1. Code Block and ROS 2 Integration
-   **Task**: Research best practices for embedding and syntax-highlighting ROS 2 (Python and C++) code blocks in Docusaurus.
-   **Questions**:
    -   Are there specialized remark or rehype plugins for ROS 2 code?
    -   How can we make code examples copy-and-paste friendly?
    -   What is the best way to present command-line snippets alongside code?
-   **Goal**: Ensure code examples are clear, accurate, and easy for students to use.

### 2. Interactive Components (Quizzes and Activities)
-   **Task**: Investigate methods for creating interactive quizzes, activities, and self-assessment tools within Docusaurus MDX.
-   **Questions**:
    -   Can we use React components within MDX to create interactive quizzes?
    -   Are there existing Docusaurus plugins for polls, quizzes, or other interactive elements?
    -   What is the best way to provide feedback to students on quiz answers?
-   **Goal**: Enhance student engagement through interactive learning experiences.

### 3. Docusaurus Theming and Customization
-   **Task**: Explore Docusaurus theming capabilities to create a unique and engaging look and feel for the textbook.
-   **Questions**:
    -   How can we customize the color palette, fonts, and layout?
    -   What is the process for "swizzling" theme components for more advanced customization?
    -   Are there pre-made themes that would be suitable for a technical textbook?
-   **Goal**: Create a visually appealing and professional-looking online textbook.

### 4. Advanced MDX Features
-   **Task**: Research advanced MDX v3 features that can enhance the textbook's content.
-   **Questions**:
    -   How can we use MDX to create reusable components for notes, warnings, and other callouts?
    -   What are the best practices for embedding diagrams (e.g., Mermaid.js) in MDX?
    -   How can we leverage MDX to create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience?
-   **Goal**: Fully leverage the power of MDX to create a high-quality online learning experience.
