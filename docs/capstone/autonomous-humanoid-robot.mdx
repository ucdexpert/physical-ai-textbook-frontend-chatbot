# Chapter 10: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

Welcome to the final chapter of the textbook! In this capstone project, you'll bring together everything you've learned to design, build, and program your very own autonomous humanoid robot.

## Designing and Building an Autonomous Humanoid Robot

This project is open-ended, so you'll have the freedom to be creative and design a robot that is uniquely your own. We'll provide you with a set of guidelines and recommendations, but the final design is up to you.

Some of the things you'll need to consider are:

-   **What tasks do you want your robot to perform?** This will influence the design of your robot, including its size, shape, and the types of sensors and actuators it will need.
-   **What is your budget?** We'll provide recommendations for components at different price points, so you can build a robot that fits your budget.
-   **What tools and resources do you have available?** You may need access to a 3D printer, a soldering iron, and other tools to build your robot.

## Integrating all the Concepts from the Textbook

This project will require you to integrate concepts from all the previous chapters, including:

-   **Physical AI and Robotics Foundations:** You'll need to apply your understanding of the fundamental principles of robotics to design and build your robot.
-   **Sensors & Perception:** You'll need to select and integrate a variety of sensors to allow your robot to perceive the world.
-   **ROS 2:** You'll use ROS 2 to create the software for your robot, including nodes for perception, control, and decision-making.
-   **Simulation:** You'll use Gazebo or Isaac Sim to test your robot's software in a virtual environment before deploying it on the physical robot.
-   **VLA and Conversational AI:** You'll have the option to integrate a VLA model or a conversational AI system to create a more intelligent and interactive robot.
-   **Locomotion & Manipulation:** You'll need to implement algorithms for walking, grasping, and manipulating objects.

## Final Project Demonstration

The culmination of this project will be a final demonstration where you'll showcase your robot's capabilities. You'll need to prepare a short presentation that explains the design of your robot, the software you developed, and the challenges you faced along the way.

Good luck, and have fun building the future!
