# Preface

This textbook is designed for students in grades 9-12 who are interested in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, accessible, and engaging introduction to the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. That's why this book is packed with hands-on activities, real-world examples, and a capstone project that will challenge you to apply what you've learned.

We hope that this textbook will inspire you to pursue a career in robotics and to become one of the creators of our future.
