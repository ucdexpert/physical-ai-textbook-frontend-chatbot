# Appendix A: Workstation Specs

To get the most out of this textbook, you'll need a computer that can handle robotics simulation and AI development. Here are our recommendations for workstation and laptop specifications.

## Recommended Specifications

-   **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or a similar Linux distribution)
-   **Processor:** Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 (or better)
-   **Memory:** 32 GB RAM (or more)
-   **Graphics Card:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or better (for Isaac Sim and other GPU-accelerated tasks)
-   **Storage:** 1 TB NVMe SSD (or more)

## Minimum Specifications

-   **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
-   **Processor:** Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5
-   **Memory:** 16 GB RAM
-   **Graphics Card:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 or better
-   **Storage:** 512 GB SSD

**Note:** While it is possible to follow along with this textbook on a computer with lower specifications, you may experience slow performance, especially when running simulations.

## Why Linux?

You may have noticed that we recommend a Linux-based operating system. This is because the vast majority of robotics software, including ROS 2, is developed and tested on Linux. While it is possible to use ROS 2 on Windows and macOS, you will find that the installation process is more complex and that some packages may not be fully supported.
