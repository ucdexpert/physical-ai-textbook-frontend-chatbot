# Appendix D: Robot Lab Tiers

Building a robot lab can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be expensive. In this appendix, we'll provide recommendations for building a robot lab at three different budget tiers: budget, mid-range, and premium.

## Tier 1: Budget Lab (< $500)

-   **Computer:** A used laptop or desktop computer with at least 8 GB of RAM.
-   **Microcontroller:** An Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico.
-   **Sensors:** A few basic sensors, such as an ultrasonic distance sensor and a line-following sensor.
-   **Actuators:** A few hobby servo motors.
-   **Chassis:** A simple 2WD or 4WD robot chassis kit.

## Tier 2: Mid-Range Lab ($500 - $2000)

-   **Computer:** A computer that meets the minimum specifications outlined in Appendix A.
-   **AI Computer:** A NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit.
-   **Sensors:** An Intel RealSense camera and a 2D LiDAR scanner.
-   **Actuators:** A set of more powerful servo motors, such as Dynamixels.
-   **Chassis:** A more advanced robot chassis, such as a TurtleBot3.

## Tier 3: Premium Lab (> $2000)

-   **Computer:** A computer that meets the recommended specifications outlined in Appendix A.
-   **AI Computer:** A NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit.
-   **Sensors:** A high-end 3D LiDAR scanner and a stereo camera.
-   **Actuators:** A full set of Dynamixel servo motors for building a humanoid robot.
-   **Chassis:** A custom-designed and 3D-printed robot chassis.
-   **3D Printer:** A 3D printer for creating custom robot parts.
