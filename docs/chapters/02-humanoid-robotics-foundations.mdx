# Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Foundations

In this chapter, we'll delve into the foundational concepts of humanoid robotics, exploring their history, anatomy, and the key components that make them work.

## History of Humanoid Robots

The dream of creating human-like machines is an ancient one, but the modern history of humanoid robotics began in the 20th century. From early automatons to the advanced robots of today, the field has made incredible progress. We'll trace the key milestones in the development of humanoid robots, from WABOT-1, the first full-scale humanoid robot, to modern marvels like Boston Dynamics' Atlas.

## Anatomy of a Humanoid Robot

Humanoid robots are designed to mimic the human body, both in form and function. This allows them to navigate and interact with environments designed for humans. A typical humanoid robot consists of:

-   **A torso:** The central part of the robot's body.
-   **A head:** Which often contains sensors like cameras and microphones.
-   **Two arms:** For manipulation and interaction.
-   **Two legs:** For locomotion.

## Key Components: Actuators, Sensors, Power Systems

Underneath the hood, humanoid robots are powered by a complex interplay of components:

-   **Actuators:** These are the "muscles" of the robot, responsible for generating motion. Common types include electric motors, hydraulic cylinders, and pneumatic actuators.
-   **Sensors:** These are the "senses" of the robot, allowing it to perceive the world. We'll explore various sensors, including cameras (vision), LiDAR (depth), and IMUs (orientation).
-   **Power Systems:** These are the "hearts" of the robot, providing the energy needed to power all the other components. We'll discuss batteries, power management systems, and the challenges of keeping a humanoid robot powered.

## Student Activity: Design Your Own Humanoid Robot

On a piece of paper, sketch out a design for your own humanoid robot. Think about what tasks you want it to perform and what kind of sensors and actuators it would need. Be creative!
