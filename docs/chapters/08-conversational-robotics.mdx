# Chapter 8: Conversational Robotics (GPT + Whisper)

In this chapter, we'll explore how to create robots that you can talk to! We'll be using two powerful AI models from OpenAI: GPT, a large language model, and Whisper, a speech-to-text model.

## Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Robots

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT have revolutionized the way we interact with computers. They can understand and generate human-like text, making them a natural fit for creating conversational robots. We'll discuss:

-   **The basics of LLMs:** What they are, how they work, and what they're capable of.
-   **Prompt engineering:** How to design effective prompts to get the desired behavior from an LLM.
-   **Connecting an LLM to a robot:** The technical challenges of integrating an LLM with a robot's control system.

## Using Speech-to-Text (Whisper) and Text-to-Speech

To create a truly conversational robot, we need to be able to convert spoken language into text and vice versa.

-   **Speech-to-Text (Whisper):** We'll use OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe spoken commands into text that can be fed into our LLM.
-   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** We'll use a TTS library to convert the LLM's text responses into spoken language that the robot can "say".

## Creating a Voice-Controlled Robot

We'll bring all these concepts together to create a simple voice-controlled robot. You'll be able to give your robot spoken commands, and it will respond with spoken language. We'll walk you through the process of:

-   Setting up a microphone to capture your voice.
-   Using Whisper to transcribe your speech.
-   Sending the transcribed text to a GPT model.
-   Using a TTS library to speak the GPT model's response.
-   Integrating all of this with a simple ROS 2 robot.

## Student Activity: Have a Conversation with Your Robot

Once you've built your voice-controlled robot, try having a conversation with it! Ask it questions, give it commands, and see how it responds. What are some of the challenges you encounter? How could you improve the robot's conversational abilities?
