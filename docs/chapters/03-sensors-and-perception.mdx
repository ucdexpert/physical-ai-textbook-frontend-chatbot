# Chapter 3: Sensors & Perception

In this chapter, we'll explore the fascinating world of robot sensors and perception. Just like humans use their senses to understand the world, robots use sensors to gather information about their environment.

## Types of Robot Sensors

Robots can be equipped with a wide variety of sensors, each providing a different type of information. Some of the most common sensors include:

-   **Cameras:** These are the "eyes" of the robot, providing visual information about the world. We'll discuss different types of cameras, including monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras.
-   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** LiDAR sensors use lasers to create a 3D map of the environment, providing precise depth information.
-   **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units):** IMUs measure the robot's orientation and angular velocity, helping it to balance and navigate.
-   **Force/Torque Sensors:** These sensors measure the forces and torques acting on the robot's joints, allowing it to interact with objects in a more controlled and delicate way.

## Sensor Fusion

Often, a single sensor is not enough to provide a complete understanding of the environment. **Sensor fusion** is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate and robust perception of the world. We'll explore different sensor fusion techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters.

## Computer Vision Fundamentals

**Computer vision** is a field of AI that enables computers to "see" and interpret the visual world. We'll cover some of the fundamental concepts in computer vision, including:

-   **Image Formation:** How images are created and represented in a computer.
-   **Image Filtering:** Techniques for enhancing and cleaning up images.
-   **Feature Detection:** How to identify interesting points and features in an image.
-   **Object Recognition:** How to train a computer to recognize different objects in an image.

## Student Activity: The "Sensor" in Your Pocket

Your smartphone is packed with sensors! Research the different sensors in your phone (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, camera) and write a short description of what each sensor does.
