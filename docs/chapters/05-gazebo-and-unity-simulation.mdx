# Chapter 5: Gazebo & Unity Simulation

Simulation is a crucial tool in robotics. It allows us to test and develop robot software without needing access to a physical robot, and it enables us to safely test our code in a wide variety of scenarios. In this chapter, we'll explore two of the most popular robotics simulators: Gazebo and Unity.

## The Importance of Simulation in Robotics

Why is simulation so important?

-   **Safety:** Testing new code on a physical robot can be dangerous, especially if the robot is large and powerful. Simulation allows us to test our code in a safe, virtual environment.
-   **Cost:** Physical robots can be expensive to build and maintain. Simulation provides a cost-effective way to develop and test robot software.
-   **Speed:** Running tests in simulation can be much faster than running them on a physical robot. We can also run multiple simulations in parallel to speed up the development process even more.
-   **Scalability:** Simulation allows us to test our robots in a wide variety of environments and scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to create in the real world.

## Introduction to Gazebo and Unity

**Gazebo** is a free and open-source robotics simulator that is tightly integrated with ROS. It provides a realistic physics engine and a wide variety of sensor models, making it a popular choice for robotics research and development.

**Unity** is a powerful game engine that is increasingly being used for robotics simulation. It provides stunning graphics and a user-friendly interface, making it a great choice for creating visually impressive simulations. Unity also has a growing ecosystem of tools and plugins for robotics, such as the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub).

## Building and Simulating a Simple Robot

We'll walk you through the process of building a simple wheeled robot in both Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn how to:

-   Create a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to describe your robot's geometry and kinematics.
-   Import your robot into Gazebo and Unity.
-   Add sensors to your robot, such as a camera and a LiDAR scanner.
-   Control your robot using ROS 2.

## Student Activity: Build Your Own World

In both Gazebo and Unity, you can create your own custom worlds for your robot to explore. Try building a simple world with a few obstacles, such as walls, spheres, and cubes. Then, try to manually drive your robot around the world without crashing.
